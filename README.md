Risk Assessment and Prioritization for the Bank's Funds
Notes
The operating environment presents several potential risks to the bank's funds. The large number of employees and sensitive customer data managed by the bank increase the likelihood of human error or insider threats. The coastal location adds vulnerability to natural disasters that could disrupt supply chains. Compliance with strict financial regulations amplifies the impact of any data or funds-related breach.

Risk Register
Risk	Description	Notes	Likelihood (1-3)	Severity (1-3)	Priority (1-9)
Business email compromise	Risk of attackers impersonating executives or vendors to authorize fraudulent transactions.	Phishing emails targeting employees are common; 120 employees are vulnerable due to email usage.	2	3	6
Compromised user database	Risk of attackers gaining access to customer data stored in the database.	The database contains sensitive customer data; a breach would result in regulatory fines and loss of trust.	3	3	9
Financial records leak	Risk of unauthorized access and exposure of financial records.	High compliance standards and sensitive financial records require protection to avoid legal penalties.	2	3	6
Theft	Physical or digital theft of funds.	The bank has strong physical security, but insider threats or digital theft could compromise funds.	1	3	3
Supply chain attack	Risk of disruption in the bank's supply chain (e.g., cash replenishment delays due to disasters).	Coastal location increases vulnerability to natural disasters disrupting supply chains.	1	2	2
Risk Prioritization and Justification
Compromised User Database (Priority 9):

The highest priority due to the high likelihood of occurrence and severe impact. A breach could result in significant financial, reputational, and regulatory consequences.
Business Email Compromise (Priority 6):

Moderately likely and highly severe due to the potential for fraudulent transactions and financial loss.
Financial Records Leak (Priority 6):

While less likely, the consequences of a financial records leak are severe, including regulatory fines and reputational damage.
Theft (Priority 3):

Less likely due to strong security measures, but its impact could be severe if it occurs.
Supply Chain Attack (Priority 2):

Least likely and moderately severe due to dependency on external factors like natural disasters.
This prioritization allows the team to focus resources on risks with the highest potential impact while continuing to monitor less likely threats.
